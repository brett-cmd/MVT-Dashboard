# MVT GUI

A graphical user interface for the [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT)](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt), which helps with conducting forensics of mobile devices to detect potential compromise.

## Overview

This GUI provides a user-friendly interface to MVT's command-line tools, making it easier to perform mobile device forensic analysis without having to remember complex command-line arguments. **NEW**: Now includes comprehensive PDF report generation for professional security analysis documentation.

   - Enter the backup path and destination
   - Provide the backup password if required
   - Click "Decrypt iOS Backup"

2. **Check iOS Backup**:
   - Select the backup path
   - Choose output location for results
   - Enable/disable fast mode and hash generation
   - Click "Check iOS Backup"

3. **Generate PDF Report** âœ¨:
   - After running any analysis that produces results
   - Click "ðŸ“„ Generate PDF Report"
   - Professional report will be created in the output directory

### Android Analysis

1. **Connect to Device via ADB**:
   - Enter device serial (optional)
   - Click "Check Device via ADB"

2. **Download APKs**:
   - Set output path
   - Choose whether to download system APKs
   - Click "Download APKs"

3. **Generate PDF Report** âœ¨:
   - After running any analysis that produces results
   - Click "ðŸ“„ Generate PDF Report"
   - Professional report will be created in the output directory

### PDF Report Features

The generated PDF reports include:

- **Executive Summary**: High-level security assessment with color-coded alerts
- **Device Information**: Complete device metadata and scan details
- **Security Findings**: Detailed analysis of IOC matches and suspicious activities
- **Application Analysis**: Breakdown of installed apps with security risk assessment
- **Network Analysis**: Process-level network activity with anomaly detection
- **Timeline**: Chronological view of security events
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized action items based on findings

### Demo Mode

Try the PDF generation feature with sample data:
```
python3 demo_pdf_generation.py
```

### Viewing Results

- Results will be displayed in the output console
- Detailed reports are saved to the selected output directory
- **NEW**: PDF reports provide comprehensive, shareable security analysis

## Dependencies

The application requires these Python packages:

- `mvt>=2.5.0` - Mobile Verification Toolkit
- `PyQt5>=5.15.4` - GUI framework
- `reportlab>=4.0.0` - PDF generation
- `matplotlib>=3.5.0` - Charts and visualizations

## Troubleshooting

- **MVT Not Found**: Ensure MVT is installed and in your PATH
- **ADB Connection Issues**: Verify USB debugging is enabled on your Android device
- **Permission Errors**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read/write to the selected directories
- **PDF Generation Errors**: Ensure reportlab and matplotlib are installed correctly
- **Missing PDF Button**: Install PDF dependencies with `pip install reportlab matplotlib`
